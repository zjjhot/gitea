Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\nForm, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\nthe Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\nForm by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\nthan the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\nLicense, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\nlicense for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\nthe recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable.

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\na. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\nas described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\nExecutable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\nreasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\nof distribution to the recipient; and\n\nb.

Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software.

This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\npart of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\nthis License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7.

This limitation of liability\nshall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\nsuch party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\nlimitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\nincidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\nnot apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\nof a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\nbusiness and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\nin this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\ncounter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\nthe language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\nbe used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\nof the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\nor under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\nsteward.\n\n10.3.

You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\na. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\nas described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\nExecutable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\nreasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\nof distribution to the recipient; and\n\nb. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\nLicense, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\nlicense for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the\nrecipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or\nlimitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the\nCovered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\nextent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\nwith respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\njudicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\nthis License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\nlimitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a\ntext file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under\nthis License.

The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\nfail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\nthen the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\nare reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\nexplicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing\nbasis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by\nsome reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into\ncompliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are\nreinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have\nreceived notice of non-compliance with this License from such\nContributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt\nof the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\nlicense agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\nvalidly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\ntermination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nCovered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis,\nwithout warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,\nincluding, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free\nof defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\nThe entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software\nis with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,\nYou (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\nrepair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\npart of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\nthis License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\nnegligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\ndistributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\ndirect, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\ncharacter including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\ngoodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\nother commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\ninformed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\nshall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\nsuch party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\nlimitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\nincidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\nnot apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\nof a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\nbusiness and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\nin this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\ncounter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\nthe language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\nbe used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\nof the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\nor under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\nsteward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\ncreate a new license for such software, you may create and use a\nmodified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\nany references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\nsuch modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\nLicenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is\nIncompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of\nthe License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be\nattached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the\nterms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n2.0.

## Authenticate to the package registry

To authenticate to the Package Registry, you need to provide [custom HTTP headers or use HTTP Basic authentication]({{< relref "doc/developers/api-usage.en-us.md#authentication" >}}).

## Publish a package

To publish a generic package perform a HTTP PUT operation with the package content in the request body.
You cannot publish a package if a package of the same name and version already exists. You must delete the existing package first.

```
PUT https://gitea.example.com/api/packages/{owner}/generic/{package_name}/{package_version}/{file_name}
```

| Parameter         | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| `owner`           | The owner of the package. |
| `package_name`    | The package name. It can contain only lowercase letters (`a-z`), uppercase letter (`A-Z`), numbers (`0-9`), dots (`.`), hyphens (`-`), or underscores (`_`). |
| `package_version` | The package version as described in the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) spec. |
| `file_name`       | The filename. It can contain only lowercase letters (`a-z`), uppercase letter (`A-Z`), numbers (`0-9`), dots (`.`), hyphens (`-`), or underscores (`_`). |

     --upload-file path/to/file.bin \
